1. Learned a bunch about MongoDB
  - [MongoDB in 30 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWbMrx5rVBE)
2. Read and watched about Node.js more, created a simple project.
  - I seem to remember a few things. Basics. npm install --save option, how require and export work etc.
  - Will continue exploring Node
  - Express is next
3. Procrastinated on making bash look better and reinstalling BunsenLabs on VM.
  - Struggled with xrandr, ended up simply installing Guest Additions
  - Installed NVM,Node,MongoDB,Sublime3,Nvim,ActualVim for Sublime... :expressionless:
  - Will continue on sunday!
