# Learning Vue.js. Still learning...

Last two days were tough. Tried too many things, failed too many times.

  Re-did the a-point app, it's a hell of a mess still. Academind, documentation and StackOverflow are saving my life. I feel like this project will never end. It sucks that I have to do it in such a hurry. I want to enjoy making it, instead it becomes a struggle.

On the bright side, I learn a bunch and app is actually starting to shape up, which, for a newcomer like me, feels pretty amazing.

What I learned in the past week? A ton. But I'm too tired to write it down and put it all up here. Thus:
```
$: git status

  On branch master
  Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
  nothing to commit, working tree clean
 
```
