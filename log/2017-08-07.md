# Learning Vue.js 


1. I've been having a real problem with nesting single page elements.
There were 2 warnings. 
	- **First**, it simply couldn't find the required component. 
	- **Second** looked like this:   
```
[Vue warn]: Unknown custom element: <tree-folder> - did you register the component correctly? For recursive components, make sure to provide the "name" option. (found in component )
```

#### Found solution on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43920680/multiple-single-file-components-and-vue-webpack-template?answertab=votes#tab-top):

The absolute minimum required for importing/exporting components is as follows:

In `Component.vue` (this is a component you want to use in your main .vue file)
```
<template>
	<div></div>
</template>
<script>
export default {
  name: 'app-nav',
};
</script>
```
In `App.vue` (your main .vue file)

```
<template>
	<div>
	//Here we are actually using the imported tag
		<component></component> 
	</div>
</template>
<script>
//This is a standard JavaScript import (Using ES2015 syntax)
import AppNav from './Components/AppNav.vue'; 
//In the export part notice the components section
export default {
  name: 'app-nav',
  components: {
//The 'components' section is required for Vue to know what components you are using in this file. (prevents error #2)
            Component 
        },
};
</script>
```
