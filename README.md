1) I do my studying for free. (Almost)
2) Self-motivation is a hell of a trick.

**I want to make a repository where all the best and free resources can be found!**

Here are the resources I found and found useful:

- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com)
